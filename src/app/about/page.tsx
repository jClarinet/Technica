                We're Juniper Brinegar, Zoe Gorbachev, and Shriyadita De - a team of students from Montgomery Blair High School. A common experience we all share is stressing out for AP and SAT studies. Our solution? Maka a website that helps with that! Inspired by Duolingo and Khan Academy, we created a program that displays AP questions (and in the future, SAT questions), and helps high schoolers study! We also have a streak tab which allows users to count how many days they've been practicing! We hope that our website keeps high schoolers excited to learn more!
